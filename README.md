One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
Project Name: thePetProject

Our website/app is to spread awareness of pet care as well as advocating for adopting pets instead of buying them. 
To get more people to learn more about pet care. We have devised a forum page for people to learn more about how they can take good care of their pets. People can either ask questions about pet care or simply post pet care facts. The more people who like the fact, the more points the user will earn, which can be accumulated to exchange for gifts like vouchers.


## Design Process
We wanted to create a simple website which is easy to navigate for users of any age groups.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Loading page
    1. See if the page loads
    2.If lottie logo is working
    3.3D models showing
2. Pet breed page:
    1. If the flexboxes are working
    2. Clicking on one catergory brings to another page.
   
3. Pet care page:
    1.If flexboxes are working
    2.Clicking on one leads to the correct next page
4. Adoption/Rehoming page:
    1. If the flexboxes shows up correctly
    2. Leads to the adoption/rehoming form
5. API Database
    1.Does the filled up forms safely land into our database
